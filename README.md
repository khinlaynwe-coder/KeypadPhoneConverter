# KeypadPhoneConverter

## Description
The **KeypadPhoneConverter** is a .NET Core Console Application that simulates typing text using a traditional mobile phone keypad. It takes user input as a series of key presses, similar to the old-style multi-tap texting (e.g., pressing '2' once outputs 'A', pressing it twice outputs 'B', etc.). The project is designed with clean, and maintainable architecture.

- **Input example**: "4433555 555666#"
- **Output**: "HELLO"
